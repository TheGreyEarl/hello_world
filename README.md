Initial repository created following GitHubs 'Hello World' Guide, currently no intended purpose


My name is Alexander. I aspire to be an Industrial Designer.
My intention is to learn to utilize the GitHub platform for document creation,
curation, and collaboration. Eventually I hope to execute a personal wiki based 
on the GitHub hosting abilities.
